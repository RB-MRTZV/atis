I'll create a comprehensive cost optimization document for your AWS multi-account environment. This will cover your current tactical solution, cost analysis, and strategic recommendations.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I've created a comprehensive cost optimization strategy document that covers your current tactical solution and provides a strategic roadmap for long-term cost management. The document includes:

**Key Highlights:**
- **Cost Savings Analysis:** Your current schedule (8AM-11PM weekdays, weekends off) reduces runtime from 168 to 75 hours weekly - a 55% reduction that could save $450K-$650K monthly
- **Strategic Roadmap:** 4-phase plan over 12 months transitioning from tactical to strategic cost management
- **AWS Instance Scheduler Migration:** Detailed comparison showing benefits of moving to the managed service for long-term sustainability
- **Cost Allocation Tags:** Critical missing component that would provide 90% better cost attribution and enable proper FinOps practices

**Additional Value-Add Recommendations:**
- Reserved Instance strategy for baseline workloads
- Spot instance integration for development environments  
- Storage and network optimization opportunities
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting framework

The document positions your current solution as a successful tactical win while building the business case for strategic investments in cost optimization infrastructure.

Would you like me to:
1. Expand on any specific section (e.g., the AWS Instance Scheduler migration plan)?
2. Provide technical implementation details for any of the recommendations?
3. Create additional artifacts like a detailed tagging strategy spreadsheet or cost monitoring dashboard requirements?
4. Add more specific calculations for particular service types based on your actual usage patterns?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
