# AWS Development Environment Cost Optimization Strategy

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive cost optimization strategy for our multi-account AWS development environment, currently spending over $1M monthly. Our tactical solution implements automated resource scheduling during business hours (8AM-11PM Sydney time, weekdays only), targeting EC2 instances, EKS clusters, and RDS databases through a tag-based approach using Python and GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

**Key Results:**
- **Estimated Cost Savings:** 55-65% reduction in compute costs for development environments
- **Weekly Runtime Reduction:** From 168 hours to 75 hours (weekdays) + 0 hours (weekends)
- **Implementation Timeline:** Tactical solution deployed, strategic roadmap spans 12 months

## Current Tactical Solution Architecture

### Overview
Our tag-based scheduling solution automatically manages AWS resources based on predefined tags, ensuring development resources operate only during business hours while maintaining environment integrity and preventing configuration drift.

### Resource Management Approach

#### **EC2 Instances (Standalone)**
- **Method:** Direct start/stop operations
- **Tags:** `Environment: dev`, `Schedule: business-hours`
- **Process:** Simple EC2 instance state management preserving EBS volumes and network configurations

#### **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**
- **Method:** Process suspension and capacity management
- **Process:** 
  1. Suspend ASG scaling processes to prevent conflicts
  2. Scale down to zero instances
  3. Resume scaling processes during startup
  4. Restore original capacity settings from GitLab artifacts

#### **EKS Clusters**
- **Method:** Node group scaling with Cluster Autoscaler management
- **Process:**
  1. Stop Cluster Autoscaler service to prevent scaling conflicts
  2. Remove admission webhooks (Kyverno) to prevent bootstrap deadlocks
  3. Scale node groups to zero instances
  4. Store original node counts as GitLab artifacts
  5. Reverse process during startup with original node group configurations

#### **Amazon Aurora RDS**
- **Method:** Cluster-level stop/start operations
- **Tags:** `Database: dev`, `Schedule: business-hours`
- **Benefits:** Maintains cluster configuration while stopping all instances

### Implementation Technology Stack
- **Orchestration:** GitLab CI/CD pipelines with scheduled triggers
- **Language:** Python with boto3 SDK
- **Configuration Management:** Tag-based resource identification
- **State Management:** GitLab artifacts for storing scaling configurations
- **Scheduling:** Cron-based pipeline triggers (8AM start, 11PM stop Sydney time)

## Cost Impact Analysis

### Weekly Operating Hours Comparison
| Period | Current (24/7) | Optimized Schedule | Hours Saved |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Weekdays (Mon-Fri) | 120 hours | 75 hours (15hrs/day) | 45 hours |
| Weekends (Sat-Sun) | 48 hours | 0 hours | 48 hours |
| **Total Weekly** | **168 hours** | **75 hours** | **93 hours (55%)** |

### Estimated Cost Savings by Service

#### **EC2 Instances**
- **Current State:** 24/7 operation
- **Optimized State:** 75 hours/week (55% reduction)
- **Estimated Savings:** 55% of EC2 compute costs
- **Additional Benefits:** Reduced data transfer and storage I/O costs

#### **RDS Aurora**
- **Current State:** Continuous operation
- **Optimized State:** Scheduled stop/start
- **Estimated Savings:** 50-60% of RDS instance costs
- **Note:** Storage costs remain unchanged, compute instance costs reduced

#### **EKS**
- **Current State:** Persistent node groups
- **Optimized State:** Dynamic scaling to zero
- **Estimated Savings:** 55% of EC2 worker node costs
- **Maintained Services:** Control plane costs continue (managed service)

### Overall Financial Impact
- **Conservative Estimate:** 45-55% reduction in development environment costs
- **Optimistic Estimate:** 55-65% reduction with full adoption
- **Monthly Savings Potential:** $450K - $650K (based on $1M+ monthly spend)
- **Annual Savings Potential:** $5.4M - $7.8M
