└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Architectural Consistency Benefits:**
- **Maintainability:** Identical patterns across EC2, EKS, and RDS schedulers
- **Reliability:** Standardized error handling and recovery mechanisms  
- **Scalability:** Consistent configuration and deployment patterns
- **Operational Excellence:** Unified monitoring, alerting, and reporting

### 2.2 Tag-Based Discovery Strategy

**Resource Identification:**
- **Tag Key:** `Schedule`
- **Tag Value:** `enabled` (resources with this tag are scheduled)
- **Scope:** All schedulable resources across all accounts
- **Flexibility:** Granular control per resource

**Example Tagging Strategy:**
```yaml
Production Resources:     Schedule = disabled
Staging Critical:         Schedule = disabled  
Development Standard:     Schedule = enabled
Testing/QA Resources:     Schedule = enabled
Demo Environments:        Schedule = enabled
```

### 2.3 Service-Specific Implementation

#### 2.3.1 EC2 Instance Management

**Standalone EC2 Instances:**
```python
# Discovery: Tag-based instance identification
instances = ec2_client.describe_instances(
    Filters=[
        {'Name': 'tag:Schedule', 'Values': ['enabled']},
        {'Name': 'instance-state-name', 'Values': ['running', 'stopped']}
    ]
)

# Operations: Direct start/stop
ec2_client.stop_instances(InstanceIds=instance_ids)
ec2_client.start_instances(InstanceIds=instance_ids)
```

**Auto Scaling Group Integration:**
```python
# Shutdown Sequence:
1. Suspend ASG processes (Launch, Terminate, AZRebalance)
2. Store original ASG configuration in tags
3. Stop individual EC2 instances
4. Maintain ASG configuration integrity

# Startup Sequence:
1. Start individual EC2 instances
2. Resume suspended ASG processes
3. Allow normal auto-scaling behavior
```

#### 2.3.2 EKS Cluster Management

**Advanced Autoscaler Conflict Resolution:**
```python
# Scale Down Process:
1. Configure kubectl for cluster access
2. Detect and disable Cluster Autoscaler deployment
3. Store node group configurations (min/max/desired)
4. Scale node groups to 0 (with max≥1 for AWS compliance)
5. Remove admission webhooks to prevent deadlocks

# Scale Up Process:
1. Configure kubectl access
2. Restore node group configurations from artifacts
3. Apply min-nodes override for flexible scaling
4. Re-enable Cluster Autoscaler with original settings
```

**Critical Innovation - Autoscaler Management:**
- **Problem:** Cluster Autoscaler fights manual scaling operations
- **Solution:** Temporarily disable autoscaler during scheduling
- **Result:** Guaranteed node termination and cost savings

#### 2.3.3 RDS/Aurora Management

**Aurora PostgreSQL Clusters:**
```python
# Discovery: Tag-based cluster identification
clusters = rds_client.describe_db_clusters(
    Filters=[{'Name': 'engine', 'Values': ['aurora-postgresql']}]
)

# Operations: Cluster-level start/stop
rds_client.stop_db_cluster(DBClusterIdentifier=cluster_id)
rds_client.start_db_cluster(DBClusterIdentifier=cluster_id)
```

**Cost Impact:**
- **Compute:** Full savings during shutdown
- **Storage:** Continues during shutdown (no additional cost)
- **I/O:** Eliminated during shutdown

### 2.4 GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

**Phased Execution Model:**
```yaml
Stages:
  validate → compute-stop → compute-start → database-stop → database-start → report

Execution Flow:
  Compute Tier (Phase 1): EC2 + ASG + EKS
  Database Tier (Phase 2): RDS + Aurora (after compute completion)
```

**Scheduling Configuration:**
```yaml
# Evening Shutdown (7 PM AEST - 1 hour buffer)
Evening Shutdown:
  schedule: "0 8 * * 1-5"  # 7 PM AEST (08:00 UTC)
  variables:
    SCHEDULE_TYPE: "shutdown"

# Morning Startup (8 AM AEST)
Morning Startup:
  schedule: "0 22 * * 0-4"  # 8 AM AEST (22:00 UTC previous day)
  variables:
    SCHEDULE_TYPE: "startup"
```

### 2.5 Safety & Reliability Features
