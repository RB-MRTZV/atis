## 🛡️ OPERATIONAL RISKS

### ✅ **COVERED - Unintended Resource Shutdown**

**Risk**: Accidentally stopping critical production resources
- **Impact**: Service outages, data unavailability, business disruption
- **Probability**: High without safeguards

**Mitigations Implemented**:
- ✅ **Tag-based filtering** - Only affects resources with specific tags (`Schedule=enabled`)
- ✅ **Comprehensive dry-run mode** - Test all operations without making changes
- ✅ **Account-specific targeting** - Limit scope to specific AWS accounts
- ✅ **Manual approval required** - GitLab CI jobs require manual trigger
- ✅ **Verification steps** - Confirm resources reach expected states
- ✅ **Detailed logging** - Complete audit trail of all operations

**Example Protection**:
```bash
# Always test first
python main.py --action stop --target both --dry-run

# Production safeguards
- Manual job triggers only
- Account-specific operations
- Tag-based resource filtering
```

### ✅ **COVERED - State Verification Failures**

**Risk**: Resources don't reach expected states after operations
- **Impact**: Incomplete operations, uncertain resource status
- **Probability**: Medium due to AWS service delays

**Mitigations Implemented**:
- ✅ **Configurable timeouts** - Different timeouts for different resource types
- ✅ **Retry mechanisms** - Polling with configurable intervals
- ✅ **Failure reporting** - Clear identification of failed verifications
- ✅ **Partial success handling** - Continue with successful resources

**Configuration Example**:
```ini
# Aurora clusters - longer timeout due to complexity
cluster_verification_timeout = 600  # 10 minutes
cluster_check_interval = 30        # 30 seconds

# RDS instances - shorter timeout
instance_verification_timeout = 300 # 5 minutes  
instance_check_interval = 15       # 15 seconds
```

### ✅ **COVERED - EKS State Management Corruption**

**Risk**: EKS node group configurations lost between operations
- **Impact**: Inability to restore original scaling configurations
- **Probability**: Medium without state persistence

**Mitigations Implemented**:

- ✅ **GitLab CI artifacts** - 7-day retention for state files
- ✅ **Dry-run safe state** - No state modifications during testing
- ✅ **Backup state validation** - Verify state file integrity before operations

**State Management**:
```json
{
  "nodegroup-1": {
    "original_min_size": 2,
    "original_max_size": 10,
    "original_desired_size": 5,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

**IAM Policy Example**:
```json
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "rds:StartDBCluster",
        "rds:StopDBCluster"
    ],
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:rds:ap-southeast-2:123456789012:cluster:production-*"
    ]
}
```
