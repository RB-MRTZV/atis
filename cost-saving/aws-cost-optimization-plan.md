# AWS Cost Optimization Assessment Plan

## Stage 1: Brief Solutions for Cost Savings

### 1. Storage Cost Optimization

**S3 Storage:**
- Implement S3 Intelligent Tiering for automatic data classification
- Move infrequently accessed data to IA (Infrequent Access) storage class
- Archive old data to Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive
- Enable S3 lifecycle policies to automate transitions
- Delete incomplete multipart uploads older than 7 days
- Use S3 Storage Class Analysis to identify optimization opportunities

**EBS Storage:**
- Right-size EBS volumes based on actual usage
- Convert underutilized gp2 volumes to gp3 for better price/performance
- Delete unattached EBS volumes and orphaned snapshots
- Use EBS optimization recommendations from AWS Trusted Advisor

**EFS Storage:**
- Enable EFS Intelligent Tiering
- Monitor file access patterns and move to IA storage class
- Remove unused file systems

### 2. Log Retention Cost Optimization

**CloudWatch Logs:**
- Reduce log retention periods based on compliance requirements
- Export old logs to S3 for long-term archival at lower cost
- Use log groups with shorter retention for non-critical applications
- Implement log filtering to reduce ingestion volume
- Consider using CloudWatch Logs Insights for analysis instead of storing all logs

**Application Logs:**
- Implement log rotation and compression
- Use centralized logging with cost-effective retention policies
- Filter out debug/verbose logs in production environments

### 3. Snapshots/Backups Cost Optimization

**EBS Snapshots:**
- Implement automated snapshot lifecycle management
- Delete orphaned snapshots from terminated instances
- Use incremental snapshots efficiently
- Set appropriate retention periods based on RTO/RPO requirements
- Consider cross-region replication only for critical data

**RDS Snapshots:**
- Optimize automated backup retention periods
- Delete manual snapshots that are no longer needed
- Use point-in-time recovery windows appropriately

**AMI Management:**
- Deregister unused AMIs and delete associated snapshots
- Implement AMI lifecycle policies

### 4. Ingress/Egress Expenditure Optimization

**Data Transfer:**
- Use CloudFront CDN to reduce data transfer costs
- Implement VPC endpoints for AWS service communication
- Optimize inter-AZ data transfer by collocating resources
- Use AWS Direct Connect for high-volume data transfer
- Monitor and optimize cross-region data transfer

**Network Architecture:**
- Place resources in the same AZ when possible
- Use private subnets and NAT gateways efficiently
- Implement efficient load balancer configurations

### 5. Amazon Macie Cost Optimization

**Macie Usage:**
- Review and optimize data discovery job frequency
- Focus scans on high-risk data repositories
- Use custom data identifiers efficiently
- Schedule jobs during off-peak hours
- Disable Macie in regions/accounts where not required
- Review findings regularly and tune sensitivity settings

### 6. Compute Utilization Monitoring & Optimization

**EC2 Instances:**
- Right-size instances based on CloudWatch metrics
- Use AWS Compute Optimizer recommendations
- Implement auto-scaling to match demand
- Consider Spot instances for fault-tolerant workloads
- Use Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for predictable workloads
- Schedule instances for development environments

**Container Services:**
- Optimize ECS/EKS resource requests and limits
- Use Fargate Spot for cost-effective container workloads
- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling

**Lambda Functions:**
- Optimize memory allocation and timeout settings
- Monitor duration and memory usage
- Consider Provisioned Concurrency usage

## Environment Assessment Approach

### Development Environment
- More aggressive cost optimization due to non-production nature
- Implement automated start/stop schedules
- Use smaller instance types and storage allocations
- Shorter backup retention periods
- Consider using Spot instances extensively

### Production Environment
- Balance cost optimization with performance and availability
- Maintain appropriate backup and disaster recovery capabilities
- Focus on right-sizing and reserved capacity
- Implement gradual optimization with monitoring

## Next Steps

1. **Data Gathering (Stage 2)**: Create Python scripts to collect current state information
2. **Analysis**: Compare current state against optimization recommendations
3. **Implementation Planning**: Prioritize optimizations based on cost impact and risk
4. **Execution**: Implement optimizations with proper testing and rollback procedures
5. **Monitoring**: Establish ongoing cost monitoring and optimization processes
