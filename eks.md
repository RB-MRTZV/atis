As an AWS architect, here are the key approaches and considerations for optimizing your EKS development environment costs:

## Blue-Green Deployment Strategy for Dev

**Primary Recommendation: Single Active Cluster for Dev**
- Maintain only one active cluster in development environments
- Implement proper cleanup automation that terminates the "old" environment after successful deployment validation
- Reserve true blue-green for production where zero-downtime is critical
- This alone could cut your cluster costs in half

**Alternative: Time-Boxed Blue-Green**
- Keep both environments for a maximum of 2-4 hours post-deployment for testing
- Automated cleanup based on deployment success metrics or time limits

## Node Scheduling Approaches

**1. Karpenter-Based Solution (Recommended)**
- Configure Karpenter node pools with time-based disruption policies
- Use node pool weights and taints to control scheduling windows
- Leverage Karpenter's native support for scheduling constraints
- More flexible and cost-effective than cluster autoscaler

**2. Lambda + EventBridge Automation**
- Schedule Lambda functions to scale managed node groups to 0/desired capacity
- EventBridge rules for 11 PM shutdown, 8 AM startup, weekend management
- Can integrate with your existing Terraform state to identify target node groups
- Most reliable approach for consistent scheduling

**3. Managed Node Group Scaling**
- Update min/max/desired capacity via AWS APIs on schedule
- Simpler than Lambda but requires careful coordination with application deployments

## Key Considerations

**Startup Time Management**
- EKS nodes typically take 3-5 minutes to become ready
- Consider pre-warming critical nodes 15-30 minutes before team arrival
- Use multiple smaller node groups rather than few large ones for faster scaling

**Storage and Persistence**
- EBS volumes persist through node shutdowns (additional cost but data safety)
- Consider EFS for shared storage that doesn't depend on node lifecycle
- Evaluate which dev workloads actually need persistent storage

**Application Architecture Impact**
- With 100+ single-pod deployments, you're likely over-provisioned for dev
- Consider consolidating less-critical services into shared dev environments
- Implement resource requests/limits to enable better bin-packing

**Cost Optimization Layers**
1. **Spot Instances**: 60-90% savings, acceptable for dev workloads
2. **ARM-based instances (Graviton)**: 20% cost reduction
3. **Right-sizing**: Analyze actual CPU/memory usage patterns
4. **Reserved capacity**: If you have predictable baseline requirements

**Migration Considerations**
- Plan Karpenter migration during low-activity periods
- Test scheduling behavior in a single cluster first
- Ensure monitoring and alerting work with scaled-down infrastructure
- Document the new developer workflow for accessing environments

**Security and Compliance**
- Ensure scheduled shutdowns don't interfere with security scanning schedules
- Consider compliance requirements for data retention during shutdowns
- Implement proper IAM roles for automation components

**Risk Mitigation**
- Always maintain at least one cluster running for emergency access
- Implement circuit breakers to prevent shutdown during active development
- Create runbooks for manual intervention when automation fails

The combination of eliminating redundant blue-green clusters in dev and implementing Karpenter-based scheduling should deliver 60-80% cost reduction while maintaining developer productivity. Start with the blue-green optimization as it's lower risk and immediate impact, then layer in the scheduling solution.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
