Log filtering reduces costs by blocking unnecessary logs from reaching your storage system, so you only pay for logs that actually matter.

**How it works:** Set up rules that drop unimportant logs before they get stored.

**Example filters:**
- **Drop debug logs in production:** Only keep ERROR and WARN levels, filter out DEBUG/INFO
- **Remove health checks:** Filter out `GET /health` endpoint calls that happen every 30 seconds
- **Skip static file requests:** Block logs for `.css`, `.js`, `.png` file requests
- **Filter by source:** Only keep logs from critical services, drop test environment logs

**Before filtering:** 1TB of logs/day = $150/month
**After filtering:** 200GB of logs/day = $30/month (80% cost reduction)

**Implementation:**
```
# Example filter rule
if log_level == "DEBUG" or url.contains("/health") or source == "test-env":
    drop()
```

The key is identifying which logs provide business value versus noise. Most systems generate 70-90% unnecessary logs that can be safely filtered out without losing important troubleshooting information.
