I’ll help you create Excel formulas and visualization approaches for your AWS cost analysis. Here are several methods you can implement:

## Analysis Formulas

### 1. Cost Analysis by Environment

Create a summary section with unique environments and use SUMIF formulas:

**Setup:**

- In a new area (e.g., columns I-J), list unique environments
- Use formulas to calculate totals

**Formulas:**

```excel
# Total Monthly Cost per Environment
=SUMIF(A:A,"Production",F:F)  # Replace "Production" with cell reference

# Total Estimated Savings per Environment  
=SUMIF(A:A,"Production",G:G)

# Net Cost after Savings per Environment
=SUMIF(A:A,"Production",F:F)-SUMIF(A:A,"Production",G:G)
```

### 2. Cost Analysis by Service Type

Similar approach for service analysis:

**Formulas:**

```excel
# Total Monthly Cost per Service
=SUMIF(B:B,"EC2",F:F)  # For EC2 services

# Total Estimated Savings per Service
=SUMIF(B:B,"EC2",G:G)

# Instance Count per Service
=SUMIF(B:B,"EC2",D:D)
```

### 3. Advanced Analysis with SUMIFS (Multiple Criteria)

For more granular analysis:

```excel
# Cost for specific Environment + Service combination
=SUMIFS(F:F,A:A,"Production",B:B,"EC2")

# Savings for specific Environment + Service
=SUMIFS(G:G,A:A,"Production",B:B,"EC2")
```

## Visualization Approaches

### 1. Pivot Tables (Recommended)

**Advantages:** Dynamic, easy to update, built-in charting

- Insert → Pivot Table
- Drag Environment to Rows, Service to Columns
- Drag Monthly Cost to Values
- Create charts directly from pivot table

### 2. Traditional Charts with Summary Tables

**Setup summary tables first, then:**

- Select summary data
- Insert → Charts → Column/Pie charts
- Recommended chart types:
  - **Stacked Column Chart:** Environment vs Service costs
  - **Pie Charts:** Service distribution, Environment distribution
  - **Clustered Column:** Current vs Post-savings costs

### 3. Dashboard Approach

Create a dedicated dashboard sheet with:

- Summary tables using the formulas above
- Multiple chart types showing different perspectives
- Slicers for interactive filtering (if using tables/pivot tables)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Preparation:**
- Ensure your data starts from row 2 (row 1 for headers)
- Convert your data range to an Excel Table (Ctrl+T) for better formula management
1. **Create Summary Sections:**
- Environment summary (columns I-L)
- Service summary (columns I-L, below environment summary)
- Combined analysis (Environment + Service matrix)
1. **Formula Implementation:**
- Use UNIQUE function (Excel 365) or manually list distinct values
- Apply SUMIF/SUMIFS formulas
- Add percentage calculations for cost distribution
1. **Chart Creation:**
- Start with pivot charts for flexibility
- Create static charts for dashboard presentation
- Use conditional formatting for visual emphasis

## Alternative Approaches to Consider

**Cost Perspective Comparison:**

1. **Excel Native (Lowest Cost):**
- Formulas + Charts as described above
- Manual updates required
1. **Power BI Integration (Medium Cost):**
- Connect Excel to Power BI for advanced dashboards
- Better for stakeholder sharing
1. **AWS Cost Explorer Integration (Variable Cost):**
- Export data directly from AWS
- More comprehensive but requires API setup
1. **Python Analysis (Time Investment):**
- More flexible for complex analysis
- Better for automation and integration

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific formula approach or chart type? Also, do you have a preference for which environment names and services I should use in the formula examples?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
